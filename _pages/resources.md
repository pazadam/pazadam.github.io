## [Itiner-e: The Digital Atlas of Ancient Roads](https://itiner-e.org/)

This is today the most comprehensive and detailed digital representation of the Roman road network available. I was involved in its creation while at UrbNET in Aarhus University with [Tom Brughmans](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/t.b%40cas.au.dk). Together with Tom and [Pau de Soto](https://portalrecerca.uab.cat/en/persons/pau-de-soto-caãamares) (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona) we continue to maintain and develop the platform.
